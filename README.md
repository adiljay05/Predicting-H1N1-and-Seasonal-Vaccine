# Predicting H1N1 and Seasonal Vaccine

## This repository contains a paper that shows the models used and the comparison of the models used to predict H1N1 and Seasonal Vaccine.

There were 6 algorithms used. Following is the list along with the accuracies achieved for H1N1.
1. Decision Trees J48 - 84.1667%
2. Random Forest - 84.4729%
3. Logistic Regression - 85.1852%
4. SVM - 84.9187%
5. SGC - 84.4906%
6. KNN - 82.7228%

Following Accuracies were achieve for Seasonal Vaccines.
1. Decision Trees - 77.3978%
2. Random Forests - 77.6002%
3. Logistic Regression - 78.9964%
4. SVM - 78.8142%
5. SGC - 77.9846%
6. KNN - 76.4063%

## We can conclude that Logistic regression was proven to be best for both seasonal and H1N1 vaccines prediction.
